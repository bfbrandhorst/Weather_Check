# Weather_Check

Welcome to Weather Check, a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. In the search bar enter a city name and you will be provided with realtime weather and five day forecast for your desired location. All searched cities will save for easy access the next time you need to get the forecast. Please check out the images of my application in the links below. If you have any questions or comments click the link to the page's repository at GitHub where you can find my contact information.
